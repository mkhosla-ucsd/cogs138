# Reading 4

- Evan M. Peck, et al., 2019, Attitudes and Perceptions of Data Visualization <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ucsd.cogs9/readings/r4a_Viz_in_PA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download &#x2197;</a>
- Hadley Wickham, et al., 2010, Graphical Inference for Infovis <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ucsd.cogs9/readings/r4b_graphical_inference_wickham.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download &#x2197;</a>

Reading 4 explores the concepts of what you can do with data visualizations. In class, we talk a lot about how to use basic visuals, how to communicate about data and learn to spot inefficient ways to use visuals. Wickham's paper will introduce you to very new concepts in the power of visualizations as tools to help you analyze data. Whereas Peck's paper walks you through some of the issues in data viz literacy, while also showing you what features and information people really want and need to digest a data visual, TLDR simplicity!
