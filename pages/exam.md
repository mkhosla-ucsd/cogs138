<h1>Final Exam</h1>

The final exam is an opportunity for me to test how all of you are learning the lecture material. The best way to study for the exam is to carefully review your lecture notes, think about the main topics in the lectures, and then determine the details that support each of those topics. 

{: .important }
The exam is an open note exam, to be taken at the comfort of your own home. Once you begin the exam, you must finish it in one sitting.


{: .warning }
You do not have to show up anywhere on the date and time of the scheduled final exam. The take-home final exam will be due on the day of the final at 11:59 PM. See the course calendar for the exact date.
