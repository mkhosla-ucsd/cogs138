<h1>Course Readings</h1>

Readings come from a wide range of topics, papers, and articles to reflect the diverse nature of Neural Data Science. 

The work of neuroscientists and data scientists requires extensive reading in day-to-day operations. Reading papers, meeting notes, emails, memos, project notes, and program documentation, just to name a few. The better your reading/writing abilities, the easier it will be to extract and disseminate information and knowledge. This is a fundamental and critical skill in, especially in data science. So please take the readings seriously and use them as practice to improve these fundamental skills, as well as, learn more about the field of neural data science.
