<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

1. What should we do if someone in our team drops the course or does not respond to our messages?
> Reach out to your sectionâ€™s TA and IA. Depending on the current size of your team, your TA may decide to add a new member, split your team (if everyone wants to), combine with another small team, or do nothing. This is a case by case basis and will be handled as such. For unresponsive team members, try to resolve any in group issue by yourselves first. If the issue persists, contact your TA/IA and they will attempt to reach out to the student to determine the nature of the problem. If that does not work, the professor will reach out.
