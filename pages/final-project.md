# Final Group Project

For your Final Project, I want you to explore the various approaches to Data Science you will be learning this quarter. Specifically, you are required to outline how you would integrate a variety of Data Scientific methods and theories in a project addressing a novel question that can be answered using data. Imagine you knew all the ins-and-outs of Data Science, data mining, analysis, programming, and statistics, and write your final outlining your question, hypothesis, overall approach, analysis, and conclusion.

Your question could be purely scientific (e.g., "How do different cultures perceive different colors?"), just interesting (e.g., "What are commonly misheard song lyrics?"), or statistical (e.g., "How big do crowds need to be for reliable estimates of different kinds of questions?").

Your Final Project will have the following sections: Question, Hypothesis, Background Information, Data, Ethical Considerations, Analysis Proposal, Discussion, Group Participation

Remember to proofread your essays and that you are not using overly flowery and/or vague language. Use as few words as possible, but no less, to describe your approach. Concision is key, you wouldnâ€™t over engineer a system. Correct? Why would you over engineer your prose? Think Hemmingway, not Faulkner. A small portion of your grade will be dependent on your ability to write clearly, logically, and without errors that should be caught during proofreading.

You will turn in one PDF as a group into Gradescope by the due date for part 1 and part 2. There are no late submissions accepted, unless there is an issue outside of your control. If so, email your course instructor and all your teammates before the due date.
