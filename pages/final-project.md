# Final Group Project

For your Final Project, I want you to identify neuroscientific questions that are addressable by publicly available datasets. Specifically, you are required to choose between two options: 
- Choose a paper that uses a new data analysis technique that has been published no more than 10 years ago (most should have code and data publicly available). Implement this method using a new data set (either your own or from a publicly available source).
- Come up with a neuroscientific research question of your own that is answerable with available data. You can look at some of the public datasets to frame your question. Determine an analytical approach that can be used to answer your question and implement this method.  

You will turn in one PDF as a group into Gradescope by the due date for the proposal and one jupyter notebook as a group into datahub for the final component of the project. There are no late submissions accepted for the notebook submission, unless there is an issue outside of your control. If so, email your course instructor and all your teammates before the due date.
